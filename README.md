# VBFlexGrid64

**The 64bit compatible version has now been released by Krool, so this repository has been archived. The version here is likely out of date.**
New versions can be downloaded via the twinBASIC Package Manager, or it's [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/Kr00l/VBFLXGRD).

This is an x64-compatible port of Krool's VBFlexGrid for twinBASIC

**Notes**

-This is currently set up like the StdExe version.

-Property pages have been prepared for x64 but tB does not yet support them for in-project controls (.ctl as opposed to .ocx). 

-For this project I made an x64 version of OLEGuids as a tB Package (due to longstanding issue with low-level COM/OLE interface redefinitions and midl making a TLB impossible); the project files are included here, but it's built into VBFlexGridDemo.twinproj too, so are included only for use in other projects.


**Updates**

-Arrow keys now working
